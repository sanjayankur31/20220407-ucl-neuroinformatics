# Octave scripts

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a Free and Open Source scientific programming language and tool which is drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts.

For troubleshooting, please join the [GNU Octave community forum](https://octave.discourse.group/).


Most Matlab scripts that do not use third party toolboxes usually work on Octave without too many tweaks.
This folder includes scripts with the necessary tweaks included.
